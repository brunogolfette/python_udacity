With the EduTools plugin, you can learn and teach programming languages such as Kotlin, Java, and Python in the form of coding tasks and custom verification tests right inside of JetBrains IntelliJ Platform based IDEs.
How It Works
Install EduTools plugin: Go to Preferences -> Plugins (or Configure -> Plugins from the Welcome Screen), press Install JetBrains Plugin... and search for the EduTools plugin.
Choose the learning or teaching mode: When it's installed for the first time, the EduTools plugin asks you to select whether you're a Learner or an Educator.
As an Educator:
Create your own interactive course with custom tasks, checks, tests, hints, and lots more.
Share your course publicly or privately with your students or co-workers on Stepik, a learning management, and MOOC platform. Or you can save your course as an archive file.
Let learners independently complete their assignments with the assistance of your integrated tests.

As a Learner:
Join a public interactive programming course from the list, or choose a course from Stepik, a learning management, and MOOC platform.
Start learning by filling in placeholders in the exercise code according to the task description.
Verify tasks, get instant feedback and quick results using an intelligent development tool.
